# BioSNTR_Plot_Points

This project is for the SDSU REU BioSNTR 2018 Summer Research Program

The goal of this program is to create a tool for visualizing 3-Dimensional PCA in virtual reality. Ideally, such a tool 
would be useful in gaining more understanding for various data. The primary interface for
VR will be Oculus Rift, but there may be a future adaptation for HTC Vive if time permits.

The PCA implementations are from Accord Version 3.0.2 in fear that more modern versions would not be compatible 
with Unity 2017.3 (the version of Unity used in this project).

Third-party code includes the CSV-Reader from PrinzEugn and the basic data plotting functionality from Big Data Social Science Fellows @ Penn State. 

Special recognition to Professor Xijin Ge from SDSU who acted as my advisor for the duration of the project.
